One quick and easy recipe that university students can make in under one hour is "One-Pot Creamy Chicken Alfredo Pasta."

Ingredients:

8 ounces fettuccine or any pasta of your choice
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into small pieces
Salt and black pepper to taste
2 cups chicken broth
1 cup heavy cream or half-and-half
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1 cup frozen peas (optional)
Fresh parsley, chopped for garnish (optional)
Instructions:

In a large pot, bring salted water to a boil and cook the pasta according to package instructions. Once cooked, drain and set aside.

In the same pot, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, saut√©ing until they become soft and fragrant.

Season the chicken breast pieces with salt and black pepper, then add them to the pot. Cook until the chicken is no longer pink in the center.

Pour in the chicken broth and bring it to a simmer. Add the cooked pasta back into the pot.

Stir in the heavy cream and grated Parmesan cheese, ensuring everything is well combined. Cook for a few minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.

If desired, add frozen peas to the pot and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until heated through.

Remove from heat and let the pasta rest for a few minutes to allow the sauce to further thicken.

Garnish with fresh parsley, if desired, and serve hot.

This one-pot creamy chicken Alfredo pasta is a satisfying and flavorful dish that can be prepared in under an hour. It requires minimal ingredients and provides a delicious and comforting meal for busy university students. Enjoy!
